# Jotterbox
A lightweight note-taking desktop application. \
Made for jotting down unstructured thoughts and keeping a clear head.

### Features

- Minimalistic note-taking user interface.
- Notes are stored as TSV (tab-separated values) files separated by date, with their custom tags and a 'date created' timestamp.
- Filter notes by multiple selected tags and/or a date range and export result as a TSV file.

### Simple installation

Download binaries for your operating system from the Releases page and simply run Jotterbox.exe.

### Manual installation

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

MacOS users may have to run the following command if tkinter is not installed:

    brew install python-tk

Clone this repository and, with pip installed, run the following command in the directory containing 'requirements.txt':

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Start Jotterbox by simply running 'Jotterbox.py'!
    

### Usage

- New note: With a notebook (directory of notes) open, click '+' button or just begin typing to add a new note. 
- Edit note: Click existing notes to edit their text and tags. 
- Delete note: Remove all text from a note to delete it. *(temporary method)*
- Switch between editing text and tags of a note with the 'Tab' key.
